# PixelgamesItemCloud
A modified ItemCloud plugin for PocketMine-MP

# Please do not use PixelgamesItemCloud for your server.
# If you want to use the original plugin, download it here: https://github.com/poggit-orphanage/ItemCloud

It is not advised to use this plugin because the main language is not English. In addition to that, it was modified for one specific server. EconomyPShop can't access this plugin because it has a different namespace. Only PixelgamesPlayerShops (see my repos) is compatible with this one.
[DE] Dies ist ein f√ºr den PixelCity MCPE-Server modifiziertes Plugin.

PixelgamesItemCloud is running on PixelCity (PIXELGAMES by YT_iStrafeNubzHD)
